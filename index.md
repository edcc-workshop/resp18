The objective of this one-day workshop is to explore methods for viably and coherently integrating the disparate disciplines of resiliency, security, privacy, and performance in a cloud environment. The topics of interest mirror those of general interest to EDCC as applied to this problem domain, notably:

* Cloud computing
* Interplay between safety (here articulated as resiliency), security, and performance
* Privacy-preserving cloud data access
* Protocols for confidentiality-assured cloud data operations
* Security and Compliance Management for cloud environments
* Performance impact and optimization of resiliency and security functionality
* Dependability modelling and tools, especially methods for measurement, comparison, and validation of cloud resiliency/security/performance
* Testing and validation methods
