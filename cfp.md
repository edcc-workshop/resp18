* Protocols for confidentiality-assured cloud data operations 
* Security and Compliance Management for cloud environments 
* Performance implications of cloud resiliency, security, and/or privacy features
* Dependability modelling and tools, especially methods for measurement, comparison, and validation of cloud resiliency, security, and/or performance
* Testing and validation methods for cloud security, performance, security, and/or privacy
* Performance of cloud systems and applications
* GDPR/HIPAA/PCI/GxP implications for cloud providers, cloud services, and cloud-hosted applications

* Disaster Recovery as a Service
* Design Patterns for cloud security, resiliency, availability, and/or privacy
* Cloud Management and Operations
